# To do
Last thing I did was added RxSwift using Cartfile. All is good.

Options for next things to do, in rough order.
* Swift UI to setup a simple button, where I can upload a screenshot
* OCR framework in swift
* Read that screenshot using native OCR framework (I wrote about this somewhere with links and notes to the WWDC videos, but I can't seem to find it)
* Figure out the overarching sequence diagram for how things fit together (already started on Medium)
* Setup backend, e.g. mongodb
* Write python scripts to crunch through the sudoku stuff
